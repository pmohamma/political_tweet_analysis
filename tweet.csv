AndrewYang,-0.05,0.0,6.0,2019-09-17,"@pemalevy Pema - my plan would increase the buying power of 90%+ of Americans.  Improve health, mental health, education rates. Put billions into people’s hands. I’m fighting for the eradication of poverty and the advancement of the human condition. Nothing else.  👍"
AndrewYang,0.30833333333333335,0.0,7.0,2019-09-21,Great speaking to the National Action Network this morning - we must further Martin Luther King’s vision of an economically just society.  “Capitalism forgets that life is social.” https://t.co/ZjnTJNva13
AndrewYang,0.25,0.0,6.0,2019-09-22,"I’m not running for president because I fantasized about being president; I’m running for president because, like many of you here . . .

AndrewYang,0.05,0.0,6.0,2019-09-24,"Marijuana should be legal nationwide. It is already legal in several states, it reflects a safer approach to pain relief than opiates, and our administration of drug laws is deeply uneven and racist. https://t.co/0Uhl17MW98"
AndrewYang,0.0,1.0,6.0,2019-09-24,Someone suggested a presidential town hall moderated by @SamHarrisOrg @joerogan and others that allows candidates to explain their thoughts and perspectives at length. I said “sign me up.”
AndrewYang,0.55,0.0,6.0,2019-09-29,A union leader in California told me that they are now seeing robot excavators where one person can control 6 of them from a dashboard.  He thought managing an excavator would be the kind of job that would be safe forever.
AndrewYang,0.3666666666666667,0.0,6.0,2019-09-29,@paulkrugman If you’d like to sit down and have a debate on this I would enjoy it.  We could livestream it and let people decide for themselves. This is one of the great issues of our time and it deserves careful consideration. 👍
AndrewYang,0.0,0.0,6.0,2019-10-01,"@paulkrugman Instead of citing a backward-looking stat why not get out and visit with the technologists, labor leaders, factory workers, educators, retail workers, truckers, Amazon facility workers and others who are experiencing this day-to-day? You might have a different perspective."
AndrewYang,-0.09722222222222222,0.0,5.0,2019-10-03,"@paulkrugman It’s hard to see why you are so dismissive. McKinsey, MIT, BCG, Oxford, the Obama White House, the World Bank and just about every other org who has looked at this is deeply concerned about automation. They see the same stats you and I do."
AndrewYang,0.10208333333333332,0.0,6.0,2019-10-06,@paulkrugman Thanks Paul. The productivity growth stat could be a result of the fact that many workers are being pushed into - or stuck in - low productivity sectors as a means of survival. It could also be a lagging indicator.  As you know it’s hard to pack every stat into an Op-Ed.
AndrewYang,-0.21805555555555556,1.0,6.0,2019-10-07,I like Deval Patrick. I think he is going to have a tough time getting in the race at this juncture. It’s November. It’s hard to have thousands of face-to-face conversations with early state voters at this point. It’s hard to build passion on a dime. He has an uphill climb ahead.
AndrewYang,0.1285714285714286,0.0,5.0,2019-10-07,"The first thing is to make it harder to get access to guns, particularly for young people. We need to take action on federal gun safety legislation that most Americans agree is long overdue. We owe our kids this. They deserve action. They deserve better than this."
AndrewYang,0.31666666666666665,0.0,6.0,2019-10-08,Too many young boys and men in particular are falling through the cracks in ways that can become catastrophic. We have to rebuild our capacity to form and educate healthy boys and men.
AndrewYang,-1.0,0.0,6.0,2019-10-08,"As the parent of two school age boys this is our worst nightmare come to life. I can only imagine the pain, anguish and heartbreak of the families. No one should fear sending their kids to school or going to school."

AndrewYang,0.46666666666666673,0.0,7.0,2019-10-20,Sometimes people thank me for running. But we all have a part to play. If you make the biggest contribution you can to something you care about then you can feel proud of yourself no matter what. I always feel better when I’m doing something. Running was my way of taking action.
AndrewYang,1.0,2.0,6.0,2019-10-20,On the way out West for a few days of campaigning ahead of #BetOnYang in Las Vegas! The best part - Evelyn will be joining me for part of the trip then meeting me in Atlanta.  😀 @jdschang https://t.co/kwUsOXU16l

The only 2 countries left that do not have it are Papua New Guinea and the United States of America. We need paid leave for new parents in this country immediately. I would make it happen as President."
AndrewYang,-0.13674242424242425,0.0,6.0,2019-10-22,Having spent a lot of time in Iowa and New Hampshire with voters I have been blown away by how seriously they take their duty to vet candidates. The culture has been built over decades. They compare you to candidates from past cycles. When you see it up close you appreciate it.

AndrewYang,-0.020634920634920638,0.0,6.0,2019-10-27,A guy in his 50’s said to me that he lives in fear of being replaced by someone younger and cheaper not for performance but simply to cut costs. Said “it’s tough to hit the job market at my age” and that his friends are trying to look younger for this reason. That’s not right.
AndrewYang,0.15138888888888888,0.0,6.0,2019-10-29,As a parent with two young boys I feel grateful to their teachers every day for the hard and vital work they do. We should pay teachers more. A good teacher is worth his or her weight in gold in terms of impact on our future.

AndrewYang,0.06481481481481478,1.0,5.0,2019-10-30,Mike Bloomberg is an extraordinary leader and was a stellar mayor. He has done a lot for the country. But I think it will be tough to replace hundreds or thousands of conversations with ad buys. Money has its limits and you can’t buy passion.
AndrewYang,0.21212121212121213,1.0,9.0,2019-10-31,Make sure to check out our new TV ad that launched today. Now’s the time to take this campaign to the next level - thank you #yanggang.  Let’s do it. https://t.co/vbUAY4uaTf
AndrewYang,0.1,0.0,5.0,2019-10-31,We should ban prescription drug ads on TV. Virtually no other developed countries allow them. They do nothing to make us healthier and stronger. All they do is make the drug companies more money by stimulating demand.

AndrewYang,0.2,0.0,6.0,2019-11-03,Ranked Choice Voting is just one way we can make our politics more responsive and dynamic. The most important change is to tie campaign funding to the people and wash out lobbyist cash. Democracy Dollars in our hands would make our government ours again. https://t.co/YP6A9HpOvE
AndrewYang,0.325,1.0,6.0,2019-11-03,Just spent the morning calling more winners of the Freedom Dividend - what a phenomenal gift to be in that position to change people’s lives.

AndrewYang,0.2,0.0,10.0,2019-11-05,Duke vs Kansas at the Garden tonight on ESPN.  How much are the athletes getting paid?  Zero.  The NCAA should be compensating athletes who are generating millions for their schools.  https://t.co/2yuBMiC1cK
AndrewYang,0.1621212121212121,0.0,10.0,2019-11-05,Just voted here in New York - Ranked Choice Voting is on the ballot!

AndrewYang,0.3125,0.0,10.0,2019-11-05,The press makes it seem like a horse race. Each candidate is a human being on the road away from loved ones. Not many know what it feels like from the inside. I appreciate everyone who stepped up. Win or lose.
AndrewYang,0.1,0.0,10.0,2019-11-05,I like and admire most everyone on this list. Some I consider friends. You get to know people on the road. You bond in unexpected ways.

AndrewYang,0.175,0.0,10.0,2019-11-05,Loved addressing the NAACP chapter at Drake University in Des Moines on Economic Freedom. The Freedom Dividend championed by Martin Luther King would be a game changer. Thanks @KCCINEWS8 @DMRegister @NAACPdsm for hosting. https://t.co/Gqx1pVDN7C
AndrewYang,0.125,1.0,10.0,2019-11-05,I had a chance to spend some time with Beto on the trail these past months. He was always earnest and intent on listening to people and improving their lives. His spirit of service has inspired millions - and I’m sure it will continue in the days ahead.

AndrewYang,-0.6,2.0,10.0,2019-11-05,The House approves moving forward on impeachment. Disappointing that no Republicans crossed the aisle. If that’s a sign of things to come Trump will still be there in 2020. I expect to beat him at the ballot box. https://t.co/YK8Zz0lc9k
AndrewYang,0.11666666666666665,0.0,10.0,2019-11-05,I applaud Twitter’s decision to ban political ads. It’s the rare triumph of the public good over the bottom line.
